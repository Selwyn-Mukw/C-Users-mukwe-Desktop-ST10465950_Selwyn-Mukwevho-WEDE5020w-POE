        <p>
          Mbali Bakes is a homegrown bakery founded in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. After losing her job,
          Mbali returned to her hometown of Klerksdorp, where she rediscovered her passion for baking.
          She began selling freshly baked scones and muffins in the streets of Kanana, and her goods quickly became
          community favourites — often selling out within hours. With strong local support and growing demand,
          Mbali turned her passion into a sustainable business, creating Mbali Bakes.
