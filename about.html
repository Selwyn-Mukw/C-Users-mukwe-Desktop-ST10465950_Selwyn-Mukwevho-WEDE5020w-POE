          Mbali Bakes is a homegrown bakery business founded in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. After losing her job,
          Mbali returned to her hometown of Klerksdorp, where she rediscovered her passion for baking. She began selling
          freshly baked scones and muffins each morning on the streets of Kanana. Her baked goods quickly gained popularity
          in the community, often selling out within hours. Recognizing the strong demand and support from locals,
          Mbali saw an opportunity to turn her passion into a sustainable business — and thus, Mbali Bakes was born.
